// objc_runtime.cpp — the minimal Objective-C runtime backing the web port's Foundation shim.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: Emscripten ships no libobjc at all (pass-4 finding — no headers, no library,
// nothing in emsdk's system/ or cache/). Clang will happily COMPILE Objective-C for wasm, but
// every class it emits needs a runtime to register it and every `[obj msg]` it emits calls a
// dispatch entry point that does not exist. web-port-plan.md's blocker #1 weighed vendoring
// ObjFW (a) or GCC's libobjc (b) against writing this (c), and chose (c): the needed surface is
// small and closed, whereas (a)/(b) each mean porting a foreign build system into Emscripten —
// the same risk class as the toolchain spike but for a codebase this port does not control.
//
// SCOPE — deliberately, and this is the whole reason (c) was affordable. The engine and shim use
// plain classes and message sends only: no ARC, no ObjC exceptions, no KVO, no properties, no
// +load/+initialize (grep-verified across Classes/ and src/shim/), and the only two categories in
// the tree are in seam-excluded files (FileUpload, Appirater) though category merging is
// implemented anyway since it is a dozen lines. Anything outside that will fail loudly here
// rather than silently — see unresolvedMethod().
//
// The ABI this implements is documented and MEASURED in objc_abi.h; read that file first, and in
// particular its notes (1) slot-based dispatch, (2) negative instance_size + superclass-relative
// ivar offsets, and (3) super_class arriving as a name string. Those three are where a
// from-memory implementation of "the GNU runtime" would have been wrong.
//
// THREADING: registration runs entirely in static constructors, before main, on one thread.
// Dispatch afterwards is read-mostly except for the method cache. Per CLAUDE.md convention #4 the
// only other thread in this engine is the world-load pthread; if D1's PROXY_TO_PTHREAD build ever
// sends messages from it, the cache below needs a lock (marked at its definition).

  // padding; it isn't broken on this target.
